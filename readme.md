## Final Position Paper

In this scholarly exploration titled "Embedded Humanities", we delve into the intersections of computational methodologies and the humanities, tackling the question, "Can there be a feminist text analysis?". Our discourse is deeply rooted in a critical perspective, unraveling patriarchal biases embedded in the foundational statistical reasoning that dates back to Galton's flawed hypothesis. This work highlights the inherent 'situatedness' of scientific truths, arguing for the necessity of adopting a situated and feminist objectivity in computational analysis.
