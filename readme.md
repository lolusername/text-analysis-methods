# Text Analysis Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio for my work in Text Analysis. It includes all weekly assignments and a final position paper making a case on the question: "Can there be a feminist text analysis?".

The final paper is written for an academic audience with appropriate MLA or Chicago Manual Style and includes relevant citations. The paper draws from examples in the weekly notebook assignments and secondary sources.
